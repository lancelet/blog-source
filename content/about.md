## Things about me

  - BE(Mech)/BSc, PhD (Equine Biomechanics).
  - Functional programmer at the [Commonwealth Bank (CBA)][COMMBANK] in Sydney
    Australia.
  - Mostly working in Haskell, Scala and Clojure.

## My ideal job (in case you're wondering)

  - Applied numerical programming work.
  - Involving some computer graphics or visualization.
  - Involving some aspect of manufacturing or machining.
  - Preferably in a high-tech mechanical-related industry.
  - Using a strongly typed, pure functional programming language.

## Videos

For past projects, I've occasionally been able to create short videos showing
various things. Some of them are included below.

### Anatomy of the equine forelimb

I created a 3D model of equine forelimb anatomy in [Blender][BLENDER] to explain
the structures I was dealing with to engineers. The model also became a popular
study tool for undergraduate veterinary students for a while.

### Transient dynamics of a mass-spring-damper system

As part of teaching Finite Element Analysis as part of the Masters Degree
course in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Melbourne, I created
many small animations. This one shows the transient dynamics of a 1D
mass-spring-damper system.

The code for this example is available [here][SPRINGCARTS] (sorry, it's
written in Matlab).

### FEA Solver

While I was teaching the FEA course, I wrote my own static implicit FEA
solver.

### Load Cell Example

One of the assignments during the FEA course dealt with a load cell. I built
one from spare parts to illustrate the concept.

### Home Shop Machining

I enjoy machining things when I have a garage. (Unfortunately I don't currently
have a garage in Sydney.) Apparently YouTube also likes machining; this video
had 1,700,000 views last time I checked!

I've built things for personal projects, as well as precision parts for test
apparatus that have been used in experiments.
